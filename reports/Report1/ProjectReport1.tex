\section{CS4470Y}\label{cs4470y}

\subsection{Project description}\label{project-description}

The focus will be to design and develop tools to deal more efficiently
with challenges pertaining to shortening bug fixing and maintenance
cycles and, achieving continuous delivery. There are three sections to
this project:

\subsubsection{Data Collection}\label{data-collection}

In this section we need to design and implement infrastructure for
collecting and modeling system data from diverse information sources
such as application logs, user newsgroups, and technical reports related
to application failures and application performance,

\subsubsection{Data Processing}\label{data-processing}

Next goal is to design and implement tools for processing, analyzing,
and amalgamating the acquired information into analytics reports, so
that these can be efficiently disseminated to the appropriate
stakeholders such as project managers, system architects and, developers
and,

\subsubsection{Data Integration}\label{data-integration}

Finally we need to integrate our findings into existing development
environments by designing and implementing enhancements to existing IDEs
(e.g.~Eclipse) and collaborative development frameworks, in order to
assist the appropriate stakeholders to quickly act upon the acquired
information in their native work environment, and better plan and
shorten the time required for micro-services application development,
maintenance, and deployment.

\subsection{Roles}\label{roles}

\textbf{Gurpreet Singh}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lead Architect
\item
  Documenter
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Paul Bartlett}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Project Manager
\item
  Lead Requirements Analyst
\item
  Lead Tester \& Quality Controller
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How roles have changed}\label{how-roles-have-changed}

Over the last milestone roles have not changed other than both members
trying to get in contact with the supervisor and failing.

\subsection{Revised System
Requirements}\label{revised-system-requirements}

\subsubsection{Section A : Data collection and
modeling}\label{section-a-data-collection-and-modeling}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Feature 1:} Git Based Data Collection
\item
  FR 1: Extract commits from a .git directory
\item
  FR 2: Analyze and record classes/methods effected by each commit
\item
  FR 3: Process and record the amount of code changed with each commit
\item
  \textbf{Feature 2:} Test Based Data Collection
\item
  FR 1: Record results of the test suite each time it is run
\item
  FR 2: During test phase inject previous risk analysis
\item
  \textbf{Feature 3:} Issue Based Data Collection
\item
  FR 1: Record issues filed for the code base
\item
  FR 2: Connect issues to their resolution and make an inference from
  the association
\item
  \textbf{Feature 4:} Application log based Data Collection
\item
  QR 1: Allow parsing from diverse options (User newsgroups, technical
  reports, etc)
\item
  \textbf{Feature 5:} Data combination
\item
  FR 1: Standardize and combine Git data into a central data model
\item
  FR 2: Standardize and combine test data into a central data model
\item
  FR 3: Standardize and combine issue data into a central data model
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Section B : Creating report processing
software}\label{section-b-creating-report-processing-software}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Feature 6:} Conduct Risk Analytics
\item
  FR 1: In the data model figure out risky parts of the code and mark
  them
\item
  FR 2: Identify issue keywords that are higher risk than others
\item
  FR 3: Identify impact when a test is changed (how much coverage it
  offers)
\item
  \textbf{Feature 7:} User Views
\item
  FR 1: Create a PDF report for stakeholders to see progress in codebase
\item
  FR 2: Create a Web view for exploring the risk of the codebase
\item
  FR 3: Create Github, IFTTT and Slack integrations for viewing
  framework data model
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Section C : Creating enhancements to dev
environments}\label{section-c-creating-enhancements-to-dev-environments}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Feature 8:} Continuous Integration
\item
  FR 1: Create test integration so developer can see risk rating when
  conducting tests
\item
  FR 2: Develop command line interface to the framework
\item
  FR 3: Research deployment frameworks and integrate risk analysis into
  pipe line
\item
  \textbf{Feature 9:} IDE integration
\item
  FR 1: Develop VIM plugin for viewing risk rating of each method/class
\item
  FR 2: Develop IDEA plugin for viewing risk rating of each method/class
\item
  \textbf{Feature 10:} Microservice Plug-And-Play library
\item
  FR 1: Make the framework easily deployable into a microservice
\item
  FR 2: Reduce dependencies and deliver a minimally intrusive product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Project Plan}\label{revised-project-plan}

We have no idea how well we are doing in respect to what the supervisor
wants therefore all efforts are on trying to contact the supervisor and
then development can continue afterwards. This is because we don't want
to waste time developing out of specification. Our supervisor has not
commented on our initial project plan or our initial system requirements
therefore lots of development is not possible.

\subsection{Project Deviation}\label{project-deviation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Still waiting for professor first point of contact
\item
  Still waiting to hear what the professor wants for this project
\end{itemize}
