## Background and Related Work

### Preprocessing scripts
- Extracted rsf from code 
- Formatted bug reports for processing 
- Prepares file structure for the BugLocalization project

### BugLocalization
- Used extracted bug reports and code rsf
- Produces output ranking files based on probability of containing a bug
- Written in Shell, Python and Java
- User interface was command line based with minimal input
- Only supported single operations

## Concepts

### RSF
- A map of relationships betweens tokens within a codebase
- A token is a keyword in the codebase (ex. method)
- Created using preprocessing scripts
- Allows us to verify tokens inside of bug reports

### Bug Report
- A database entry for each bug report
- Contains a String field containing what a user wrote inside their bug report

### Token Expansion
- Tokens extracted from the bug report can be expanded
- Expansion means including tokens that are referenced by the original token set 

## Development Objectives

### Develop a complete system
- Combine scripts and java code into a easy to access complete system
- System should be able to handle new codebases and improve with new bug reports

### Be able to integrate with a Github based workflow
- Fetch new issues are they are created in a repo and process them
- Push results back to the issue page so the developers can get a head start
- Allow users to authenticate using Github

### Operate as a standalone service with a UI
- Work in a similar fashion to other CI tools (like travis, etc)
- Allow users control to hook into any of their repositories
