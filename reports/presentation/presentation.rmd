## Problem Description

### Original Project Problem
- Given a collection of bug reports 
- Given a collection of code entity relationships

Determine a technique to identify root cause of a bug report

### Next step problem statement

Package a bug localization solution in a way that it is easily accessible
and pluggable into an existing project. 
Allow developers to make use of the bug localization results effectively.

## Concepts {.smaller}

### RSF
- A map of relationships between tokens within a codebase
- A token is a keyword in the codebase (ex. method, filename)
- Created using preprocessing scripts
- Allows us to verify tokens inside of bug reports

### Bug Report
- A database entry for each bug report
- Contains a String field containing what a user wrote inside their bug report

### Token Expansion
- Tokens extracted from the bug report can be expanded
- Expansion means including tokens that are referenced by the original token set 

## Concepts {.smaller}

### Clique
- A collection of tokens that are referenced the most within the expanded set of tokens

### Cluster
- A group of relationships that are closely related to each other

## Background and Related Work

### Preprocessing scripts
- Extracted rsf from code 
- Formatted bug reports for processing 
- Prepares file structure for the BugLocalization project

### BugLocalization
- Used extracted bug reports and code rsf
- Produces output ranking files based on probability of containing a bug
- Written in Shell, Python and Java
- User interface was command-line based with minimal input
- Only supported single operations

## Architecture of BugLocalization {.smaller}
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/BugLocalizationFlow.png")
```

## Development Objectives {.smaller}

### Develop a complete system
- Combine scripts and Java code into an easy to access complete system
- System should be able to handle new codebases and improve with new bug reports

### Be able to integrate with a GitHub based workflow
- Fetch new issues as they are created in a repo and process them
- Push results back to the issue page so the developers can get a head start
- Allow users to authenticate using GitHub

### Operate as a standalone service with a UI
- Work in a similar fashion to other CI tools (like Travis, etc)
- Give users the control to hook into any of their repositories 

## Development Strategy {.smaller}

### Technologies
- Kotlin
- Java
- Javalin
- MongoDB
- GitHub Webhooks

### Tools
- Intellij Idea
- NeoVim
- Robo3T
- ngrok

## Faulty Architecture {.smaller}

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}

```

## Current progress {.smaller}

### BugLocalization Project
- Restructured and cleaned up codebase
- Reduced very large codebase to 10 files 
- Documented and made more readable for easier integration 

### API
- Able to monitor a GitHub repo for events
- Detect new issues and add into a Mongo database
- Able to start and end deployments on Pull Requests

## BugLocalization Demo

## API Demo

## Limitations

### Late Start
- Second iteration of project
- Had to re-purpose project after second milestone

### Communication problems 
- Lack of communication from the supervisor for long periods of time

## Future Work and Lessons Learnt

### Future work
- Develop software to process issues incrementally into the BugLocalization
- Integrate the BugLocalization project as part of the API and utilize its full power
- Make a web UI similar to Travis to display results 

### Lessons learnt
- Develop consistent communication plan with stakeholders
